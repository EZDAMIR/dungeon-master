## 2026-09-30 — Sprint 1: Gesture Navigation

Branch: `sprint/gesture-navigation`.
Starting commit: `e9206e411ac65a04011e797ef1a61c2aadba756c`.

The working tree was clean initially. The requested reference `9ec09a95cb89a42ef58d57babfaa0fe6449db825` exists locally but is not an ancestor of the current main history. Current HEAD is later (02:34:58 +05:00 versus 02:11:43 +05:00); tree comparison shows the same scaffold with terminology/document updates. Work preserves the current history and starts from that later HEAD. No push or history rewrite was performed.

Implemented:

- Controlled video-only permission flow and camera manager with typed errors, play-before-ready, track-ended handling, startup/disposal guards and cleanup.
- Official exact `@mediapipe/tasks-vision` 1.0.1 adapter, checked against installed TypeScript declarations; one hand, VIDEO, GPU initialization with one CPU fallback.
- Reproducible official version-1 model download with SHA-256 validation and self-hosted WASM copied from the exact dependency. Automatic dev/build preparation and BASE_URL asset paths.
- Pure mirrored ROI cursor mapping, exponential smoothing, normalized pinch geometry with hysteresis/three entry samples, and held fist/Thumb Up with release/cooldown.
- Semantic events, pure application mapper/reducer, selected-workout state and camera permission mode. Pinch selects in MENU; Thumb Up confirms to CALIBRATION. Fist supports back and verifies tutorial steps.
- Five-step interactive tutorial with stable hand detection, cursor target, pinch, fist and Thumb Up. Returning to tutorial works with an already tracked hand.
- Registered accessible targets, cursor overlay, hand canvas (mirroring/letterboxing/DPR/resize), HUD/progress/recovery instructions and optional local Web Audio.
- Development-only FakeSource with the same VisionEvent pipeline; production strips fake controls.
- Source tests for bounded inference, disposal during model startup, camera errors, visibility pause/resume and one scheduled loop. Frame positions/raw landmarks do not update App state.

Verification:

| Command/check | Result |
|---|---|
| `cd frontend && npm ci` | Passed; exact lockfile installs |
| `npm run lint` | Passed, no warnings/errors |
| `npm run type-check` | Passed; checks both project references with existing strict/erasable syntax settings |
| `npm run test` | 53 tests passed in 9 files |
| `npm run test:coverage` | 53 passed; statements/lines 87.07%, branches 89.65%, functions 83.63% over runtime src; pure vision core/gestures lines 100% |
| `npm run build` | Passed; verified model SHA-256 and WASM byte parity in production output |
| `npx --no-install vite build --base=/dungeon-master/ --outDir=/private/tmp/dungeon-master-sprint1-build` | Passed; model/WASM/bundle URLs use the subdirectory base and files exist |
| Production bundle inspection | Fake controls removed; model/WASM use local paths |
| `python3 scripts/verify_architecture.py` | Passed; this existing checker verifies scaffold structure only |
| Pure core source inspection | No React, DOM target queries/clicks, backend/provider calls or video upload |
| `cd backend && make check` | Passed: Ruff format/check |
| `cd backend && make test` | 95 passed; 96.39% coverage, above the existing 90% gate |
| `git diff --check` | Passed |

Tests were first added before camera/gesture modules as required by the vision instructions, then made green. Tests found cross-environment DOMException handling, hold cooldown/release interaction and tutorial restart tracking issues; fixes retain the original TypeScript constraints. The previous solution-level type-check script did not check application references; it now runs `tsc -b`. Coverage is scoped to runtime `src/`, excluding generated vendor loaders, tests and type-only contracts; existing later-screen scaffold remains included.

Real camera verification: **not performed**. No browser/webcam tool is available in this environment. Camera/model tests are mocks, and real inference latency, tracking stability, GPU/browser compatibility and thresholds on different people are unverified. See `SPRINT_1_MANUAL_CHECKLIST.md` (24 steps plus device/lighting matrix). Code and automated acceptance are implemented; real-camera reliability acceptance remains pending.

A separate edit appeared in `AGENT_PROMPT.md` during work (leading `/` in the first heading). It was reported, preserved and excluded from Sprint 1 commits. Backend code, protected architecture contracts and later-Sprint capabilities were not changed.

Privacy: no microphone, video recording, image retention, raw frame upload or backend/provider request in the frame loop. Only model/WASM assets are loaded. Generated assets, build output, coverage and dependencies are excluded from git.

Next safe task: execute the Sprint 1 manual camera checklist and tune configuration only if observations require it. Sprint 2 remains planned: pose calibration, squat state machine, repetition counting and concrete technique-error feedback.
